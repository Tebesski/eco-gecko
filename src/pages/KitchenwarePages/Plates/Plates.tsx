                     Our line of palm leaf tableware was designed to provide an{" "}

                     plates and bowls made from fallen palm leaves which in the
                     past <b>were often collected and burned</b>. So not only
                     does using this natural by-product from areca palm trees
                     stop the senseless burning of a useful product, but it also{" "}
